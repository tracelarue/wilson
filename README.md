## About Wilson

Wilson is an autonomous robot featuring a differential drive base and a 4-DOF manipulator arm, designed to be your personal beverage assistant! With Google's Gemini Live API, Wilson can conversationally interact with users and execute tasks based on natural language requests. His main directive? **Getting you a drink from the mini fridge!** *(in development)*

### Why I Built Wilson

I wanted to create a robot that could bridge the gap between advanced AI capabilities and real-world physical interaction. The goal was to build something impressive technically, build a robust set of robotics skills, and impress any guest who comes to my house - starting with the simple (but apparently not so simple), satisfying task of fetching drinks on command.

### How Wilson Works

Wilson operates on **ROS2 Humble** and combines a wide range of hardware and sensors:

**üß† AI & Interaction:**
- Google Gemini Live API for natural conversation and task understanding
- Real-time audio/visual processing for environmental awareness
- Tool execution based on conversational commands

**üîß Hardware:**
- **Computing**: Raspberry Pi 5 (8GB) as the main brain
- **Control**: 2 Arduino Nanos for drive and arm control
- **Sensors**: 
  - LD-19 LiDAR for navigation and mapping
  - AruCam ToF camera for depth perception  
  - USB camera for visual recognition
  - Microphone for listening to the user
  - Novel soft 3D force sensor in the gripper (developed by Dr. Jonathan Miller, et al. at the University of Kansas)
- **Motors**:
  - 2, GA37-520 DC motors with integrated encoders
  - 5, 20 kg digital servos
- **Power**:
  - 3S, 5200 mAh LiPo battery
- **Other**:
  - USB Speaker for responding to the user

## ü¶æüî® Design & Manufacturing

*SolidWorks CAD Design - The original 3D model*

I designed every component of Wilson (except the tracks/wheels) in SolidWorks and 3D printed the entire chassis and manipulator at home.

Wilson was designed with modularity and servicability in mind. The head, body, base, and track mounts are all seperate components to allow for easier fixes and design changes down the road. 

All of Wilson's electronic components are mounted internally on a modular rail system. This allows for easy removal of components for fixing or upgrading.

## Simulation & Testing üë®‚Äçüíª
Wilson's simulation leverages both **Gazebo** and **RViz** for an accelerated robotics development workflow:

### Gazebo Simulation

Gazebo provides a realistic 3D environment where Wilson's physical model, sensors, and actuators are simulated. You can simulate Wilson navigating, manipulating objects, and interacting with its environment just like in the real world. The simulation includes:

- Physics-based movement and collisions
- Sensor emulation (LiDAR, cameras, force sensors)
- Interactive objects (Coke can)


### RViz Visualization

RViz is used for visualizing sensor data, robot state, and planning. In Wilson's simulation, RViz displays:

- The robot model
- Real-time LiDAR scans, depth camera point clouds, and images from a simulated camera
- Navigation maps and planned paths
- Manipulator arm trajectories
- AI-generated position markers for detected objects

You can use RViz panels to send navigation goals, control the arm, and monitor AI perception outputs. This combination of Gazebo and RViz enables rapid testing and debugging of Wilson's autonomous and conversational capabilities before deploying to hardware.

Follow these steps to set up Docker and run Wilson's simulation:
(Tested on Ubuntu 22.04, latest Docker)
### Prerequisites Setup

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** You will need root or sudo access to complete these steps.

1. **Update system packages and install prerequisites:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install -y git curl
   ```

2. **Clone Wilson repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tracelarue/wilson.git
   cd wilson
   ```

3. **Create API key file** (for AI voice/text commands):
   Create a `.env` file in the wilson directory with your Google API key:
   ```bash
   echo "GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here" > .env
   ```
   Replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual Google Gemini API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com). Without this file, Wilson will work but won't have AI-powered voice commands and object recognition capabilities.

4. **Install Docker:**
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
   sudo sh get-docker.sh
   ```

5. **Configure Docker permissions (Optional):**
   If you don't want to use `sudo` with docker commands:
   ```bash
   sudo groupadd docker
   sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
   reboot
   ```
   **Note:** We'll use `sudo` for simplicity in the following steps.

6. **Check Docker service:**
    ```bash
    systemctl is-enabled docker
    ```
    If the output is not `enabled`, start and enable Docker with:
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl start docker
    sudo systemctl enable docker
    ```

7. **Configure X11 forwarding for GUI applications:**
   ```bash
   echo "xhost +" >> ~/.bashrc
   echo "xhost +local:docker" >> ~/.bashrc
   ```

### Running Wilson Simulation
Run these commands with `sudo` privileges:

1. **Pull the ROS 2 base image (~3-5 min):**
   ```bash
   sudo docker image pull osrf/ros:humble-desktop-full
   ```

2. **Build Wilson's Docker image (~3-5 min)** (must be run from the wilson directory):
   ```bash
   sudo docker build -t wilson_image .
   ```

3. **Run the Wilson container:** (must be run from the wilson directory):
   ```bash
   sudo docker run -it --user ros --network=host --ipc=host \
     -v $PWD:/wilson \
     -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix:rw \
     --env=DISPLAY=:0 \
     --env=QT_X11_NO_MITSHM=1 \
     -v /dev:/dev \
     --privileged \
     --name wilson \
     wilson_image
   ```


### Starting the Simulation

Once inside the container, start Wilson's simulation with:

```bash
colcon build --symlink-install && \
source install/setup.bash && \
ros2 launch wilson wilson_sim.launch.py
```

### Controlling Wilson üéÆ

After the simulation launches, you have multiple ways to control Wilson:

- **RViz Panels**: Use the Nav2 and MoveIt panels in RViz for navigation and manipulation
- **Teleop Keyboard**: Control Wilson directly with keyboard inputs
- **AI Voice/Text Commands**: Talk or type to Gemini for natural language control

#### AI Commands Examples:
- "Go to the kitchen"
- "Go to the living room" 
- "Go to the mini fridge"
- "What do you see?"
- "Find the 3D position of [object]" - This will display a marker in RViz showing the detected object's location

Wilson combines autonomous navigation, manipulation, and AI-powered interaction to create an intelligent robotic assistant!

### Container Management

**Execute commands in a running container:**
If Wilson is already running in a container, you can access it with:
```bash
sudo docker exec -it wilson /bin/bash
```
