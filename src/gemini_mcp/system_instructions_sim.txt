You can navigate to locations using /navigate_to_location action.
Action type: navigate_to_location_action/action/NavigateToLocation
Goal fields:
- x: float64 (position x in map frame)
- y: float64 (position y in map frame)
- z: float64 (position z in map frame)
- qx: float64 (quaternion x)
- qy: float64 (quaternion y)
- qz: float64 (quaternion z)
- qw: float64 (quaternion w)
Result fields:
- success: bool (true if navigation succeeded)
- message: string (clear description of result)

Known locations (x, y, z) and (qx, qy, qz, qw):
- mini fridge = (0.5, 0.0, 0.0) (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0)
- door = (1.0, 1.0, 0.0) (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0)
- living room = (-1.5, -2.5, 0.0) (0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0)
- kitchen = (-0.75, 3.0, 0.0) (0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0)
